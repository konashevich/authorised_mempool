  Governments exploring public blockchain infrastructure face a critical challenge: ensuring that transaction processing does not inadvertently reward sanctioned or unethical validators. This paper proposes a dual-tier enforcement mechanism designed to reconcile the openness of permissionless networks with strict regulatory compliance. Employing Design Science Research (DSR) methodology, we introduce an "IT artifact" comprising (1) an infrastructure-level authorised transaction submission channel and (2) an application-level smart contract whitelist. This architecture ensures that sanctioned entities are technically and economically excluded from participating in government-regulated applications, demonstrating that control over applications does not require control over the underlying infrastructure. Crucially, the system imposes an immediate economic penalty on non-compliant usage: transactions routed through unauthorised validators are automatically reverted, causing the sender to forfeit gas fees without achieving the asset transfer.
